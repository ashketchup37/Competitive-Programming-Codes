# Competitive-Programming-Codes

I like solving problems. I have been solving programming problems since I was in 10th grade. <br><br>
In recent years though, I feel like I am stuck in my comfort zone. I have been solving problems, that don't challenge me enough to learn new things. Also I never had any system that tracks all the problems I have solved. To Solve that problem, I am trying to use my github profile to store them. It'll work as an extra motivation for me to solve more challenging problem.

Let's get started & <b>Happy Coding</b>
